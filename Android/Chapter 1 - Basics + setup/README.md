# Chapter 1 - Basics + setup

## Objective
Set everything up and get the basics of Android development.

## Duration
Up until the third laboratory (week 3).

## Important notes:
- Before everything, download and install [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/#!/download) and make sure that you will run every application on a virtual machine created in Genymotion. You can find a simple installing and usage guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU75HgTwtJY)
- Do not use Eclipse for Android development! Always prefer Android Studio (as you'll see in the tutorials)

## Video list
1. Mandatory: first 20 videos from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAbQgLGKd3Y&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBsvRxJJOzG4r4k_zLKrnxl)
